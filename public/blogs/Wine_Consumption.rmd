## Countries that love to get drunk on wine!

*This was a project that we created during our course in Applied Statistics to visualise the top 25 wine consuming countries in the world.* 

```{r, setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```


```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(vroom)
library(tidyquant)
```

We start off by loading our data frame and then checking which values were missing.

```{r, load_alcohol_data}

# Loading the data

library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)

```

```{r glimpse_skim_data}

# Missing values in the data

glimpse(drinks)
skim(drinks)

```

From the skim function, we can see that there were no missing values, the variables were either integers, characters or doubles.

We now plot and take a look at the top 25 wine consuming countries in thr world.

```{r wine_plot}

# Filtering the data to get only wine drinkers

wine_25 <- drinks %>% 
  arrange(desc(wine_servings)) %>% 
  top_n(25, wine_servings) 

# Visualising the data in the form of a bar chart 

wine_countries_top_25 <- ggplot(wine_25, aes(x=wine_servings, y=reorder(country, wine_servings))) + 
  geom_col(fill = "red", alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = wine_servings, hjust = -0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Top 25 wine consuming countries in the world", x="Wine servings", y="Country") +
  theme_bw()

```

```{r hillary_trump_top10 , echo=FALSE}
wine_countries_top_25
```

## Graphical analysis

It is clear from the graph that most of the top 25 wine consumers in the world are in Europe, out of which the French seem to drinking the most amount of wine (well, that came as no surprise). 

What's interesting to note is that the 1st and the 25th largest wine consuming countries in the world vary significantly in their consumptions, i.e. in Ireland the wine consumption is ~ 44% of that consumed in France. 

**INTERESTING FACT**

Did you know that the reason why the French can eat vast amounts of egg, butter, cheese and still have a comparatively low heart disease is because their wine consumption (in moderation) nullifies the "bad" cholestrol production in the body. This is famously known as the "French Paradox".

**INTERESTING FACT**
Drink to your heart's content to keep your heart healthy (like the French), but in moderation!
