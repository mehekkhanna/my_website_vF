## 2016 California Contributors for Hillary vs. Trump

*This was a project that we created during our course in Applied Statistics to understand the difference in contribution received (in $) b/w Hillary and Trump in the US 2016 Presidential Elections.* 

```{r, setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=12, 
  fig.height=8,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(vroom)
library(tidyquant)
```

The graphs illustrate the top 10 cities (in California) from where Hillary and Trump received their contributions. To start off, we imported the California contributors dataset, the zip code data base and merged both datasets to get a new dataframe.

```{r, load_CA_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Loading dataframes
CA_contributors_2016 <- vroom::vroom(here::here("data","CA_contributors_2016.csv"))
zip_code <- vroom::vroom(here::here("data","zip_code_database.csv"))

# Changing the column zip of our zip_code dataframe to a numeric value
zip_code <- zip_code %>% 
  mutate(zip = as.numeric(zip))

# Merging dataframes
CA_contributors_2016 <- CA_contributors_2016 %>% 
  inner_join(zip_code, by =  "zip")
```

Next, we cleaned our dataframe and calculated the variables that were used in our analysis.

```{r, clean_data}

# Cleaning the data

CA_contributors_2016_cleaned <- CA_contributors_2016 %>%
  group_by(cand_nm,primary_city) %>% 
  summarise(total_amt = sum(contb_receipt_amt)) %>% 
  select(candidate = cand_nm, city = primary_city, money_raised = total_amt)

```

We then plotted Trump and Hillary's top 10 contribution cities graphs separately using the following R code.

```{r, hillary_trump_top10}

library(scales)

# Plot Hillary's top 10 contribution cities
hillary <- CA_contributors_2016_cleaned %>%
  filter(candidate == "Clinton, Hillary Rodham") %>%
  top_n(10, wt = money_raised) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = money_raised, y = reorder(city, money_raised))) + geom_col(fill = "dodgerblue3") +   
  facet_grid(.~candidate) +
  labs(title = NULL, x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) + 
  theme_update(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + #center the title
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = "grey"), 
        stip.text = element_text(size = 8, color = "black"),
  ) + 
  theme_bw()

# Plot Trump's top 10 contribution cities
trump <- CA_contributors_2016_cleaned %>%
  filter(candidate == "Trump, Donald J.") %>%
  top_n(10, wt = money_raised) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = money_raised, y = reorder(city, money_raised))) + geom_col(fill = "brown3") +   
  facet_grid(.~candidate) +
  labs(title = NULL, x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) + 
  theme_update(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + #center the title
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = "grey"), 
        stip.text = element_text(size = 8, color = "black"),
  ) + 
  theme_bw()

library(patchwork)

# Combine them together and add a main title/x axis
hillary_trump_top10 <- hillary + trump +
  plot_annotation(title = "Where did candidates raise most money?", caption = "Amount Raised") 
  theme_update(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.1, face = "bold"),
               aspect.ratio = 9/4,
               plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.55, vjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

```  

Finally, with the help of ggplot() we visualised the top 10 cities (in terms of contribution amount) for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

```{r hillary_trump_top10 , echo=FALSE}
hillary_trump_top10
```

## Graphical analysis

As can be seen in the graph above, there is variation between where the candidates got the highest contributions from. For e.g., while Hillary Clinton witnessed the highest contributions from San Fransisco, the same isn't true for Donald Trump. (Perhaps, people in San Fransisco don't really love Trump's policies and ideologies - well thank god for that!)

What's interesting to note is that despite not winning the presidential elections, Hillary Clinton actually received more contributions from California than Trump did. This could mean that the people in California (at least in these top 10 cities) favour Hillary Clinton more than Trump, or it could also mean that a few people contributed extravagantly to Hillary's contribution resulting in an increase in amount raised.
